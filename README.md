*   `Household Income` - The respondent's income
*   `Education` - The respondent's education level

*   `Do you consider yourself to be a fan of the Star Wars film franchise?` - Has a `Yes` or `No` response

There are several other columns containing answers to questions about the *Star Wars* movies.
